## Development process with the simulator

Follow these steps to develop your Robolab solution and test them with the simulation server and its tests:

1. Git-clone this repository.

2. Change directory into your clone and the package/ directory.

        $ cd RobolabSim/package

3. Edit solution/c/h/Communication.h with your group ID.

4. You can now write your solution in solution/c/src/

5. Compile your solution. ** see the README in solution/ **

6. Start the simulation server:
	
	$ java -jar RobolabSim.jar

7. Run your compiled solution (see 5).

8. Visit http://localhost:8080
